# Test Driven Development With Jest

## Description

Code challenges (HackerRank) and documentation for Jest testing, with a focus on a TDD approach. 

## Approach

Red - Write a test. The test fails because you haven't written any code yet.

Green - Write code that passes your test (and all previous tests). Don't be clever, just write code so your tests pass!

Refactor - Refactor your code! There are many reasons to refactor, such as efficiency, code style, and readability. Make sure your code passes your tests as you refactor
